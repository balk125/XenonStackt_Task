This is a simple fully working login  and  signup project created using PHP (XAMPP server) , Mysql, HTML CSS.

A signup page (also known as a registration page) enables users and organizations to independently register and gain access to your system. It is common to have multiple signup pages depending on the types of people and organizations you want to register.

#How to Use the Project
In this project I have created a login and signup page where first of all you have to register in to this. When you click on the register button then a popup will appear above the home page where you have to fill all the details like name, username, email, password.

After that when you click on the register button it will check is your email or username already exist or not. If your with the same email are not exist in the database   insert query is generated and data is inserted into database otherwise it will give alert that user already exist.

Now, when you click on the login button a login popup will appear on the screen and you have to enter your username or email and password and then click on the submit button. After clicking on the submit button the program will check is your username or email registered or your password is correct or not. If your password is incorrect then a wrong password popup alert massage will appear and if everything is good then you will be successfully logged in.

Also this web application has a contact us page where you have to enter your details like name email phone number, and query and click on submit button and all the data is inserted into contact_data table of mysql.
